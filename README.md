# sort-visualizer
Visualization of sorting algorithms on the HTML canvas.

<a href="http://xmityaz.github.io/sort-visualizer/">watch the demo</a>

## Description
The project made for self-education and to have some fun.

Visualization based on a ES6 generators. 
All sorting algorithms are generators which yield current state of sorting array and active items at each iteration. The realisation might be easier (especially for recursive algorithms) but learning sorting algirithms + learning ES6 features = WinWin ðŸ˜‰

All algorithms had been writing from scratch and may differ from the standard implementation. If you find some algorythm working wrong, please let me know (via issue or PR ðŸ™‚).
